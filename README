A client for the `Dovecot Authentication Protocol v1.1`__.

.. __: https://wiki2.dovecot.org/Design/AuthProtocol

Why?
====

Dovecot is a convenient authentication backend for some stuff running on my
server, most notably the OpenID provider it looks as if I'm going to have to
write, and it's less trouble to write a small client to talk to it than get
something talking to PAM.

I figure that somebody might be in the same position, so why not unbundle it
from the OpenID provider.

For testing purposes, I might also write a small daemon that implements the
protocol using `passlib` behind the scenes, though don't expect it to be super
robust.
